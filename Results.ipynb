    "## Interpretations and Discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RMSprop Optimizer\n",
    "   - This optimizer achieved the highest training accuracy among the three, indicating that it might have converged faster or found better local minima during training.\n",
    "   - The validation accuracy is slightly lower than the training accuracy, suggesting some degree of overfitting, though the gap between training and validation accuracies is not too large.\n",
    "   - The loss value is relatively high compared to the other optimizers, indicating that the model might still have room for improvement in terms of minimizing the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adam Optimizer\n",
    "   - The training accuracy is lower than RMSprop but still reasonably high.\n",
    "   - The validation accuracy is also lower than RMSprop, indicating that Adam might not have converged as well as RMSprop on this specific dataset.\n",
    "   - The loss value is lower than RMSprop, suggesting that Adam might have found a better optimization path compared to RMSprop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adagrad Optimizer\n",
    "   - Both the training and validation accuracies are lower compared to RMSprop and Adam.\n",
    "   - The loss value is the lowest among the three optimizers, indicating that Adagrad might have found the optimal parameters more efficiently in terms of the loss function.\n",
    "   - However, the accuracy metrics are relatively lower, indicating that it might not generalize as well as the other optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RMSprop seems to strike a balance between training accuracy and generalization (validation accuracy). It has a high training accuracy but slightly lower validation accuracy, indicating some level of overfitting.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Adam performs reasonably well but might not generalize as effectively as RMSprop. It converges faster than RMSprop in terms of loss minimization but lags slightly in validation accuracy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Adagrad achieves the lowest loss value but does not perform as well in terms of accuracy metrics, indicating potential issues with generalization."
