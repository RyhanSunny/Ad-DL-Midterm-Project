# Ad-DL-Midterm-Project


Our project includes four Python (.py) files, each containing model functions designed for neural networks with 3, 6, and 12 layers respectively and utils.py for the fashion mnist label names.

Additionally, I provide four Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files to facilitate your work. 

- The first 3 notebook, named **fashion_mnist_optimizer*.ipynb**, is specifically set up for experimenting with different optimizers to understand their impact on model performance, each person takes one. 

- The last notebook, **3_6_12layer_NN_model.ipynb**, focuses on comparing the accuracy of models constructed with 3, 6, and 12 layers. It is important to note that the evaluations in this second notebook are conducted without applying any optimizers, providing a baseline performance metric for each model configuration.
